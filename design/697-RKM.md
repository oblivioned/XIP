# Proposal: Restore private key with mnemonic

Author(s): gjj

Last updated: 2020-04-14

## Abstract

Users can use xchain-cli to restore private key with mnemonic

## Background

Because the private key is complex and difficult to remember, mnemonic help is required.Initiating a transaction requires a private key, so starting a transaction without forgetting or losing the private key requires a mnemonic to restore account information, including the private key.

## Proposal

Add an instruction (. /xchain-cli account restore) to restore the mnemonic account

## Rationale

none

## Compatibility

Highly compatible

## Implementation

1. Add account recovery instruction (account_restore.go) in cli module

2. Add flag to account_restore.go: mnemonic is used to specify the mnemonic entered by the user and lang is used to specify mnemonic language(zh|en, default zh). 

   such as : 

    ./xchain-cli account restore --mnemonic "累 铝 影 予 细 碳 永 诺 您 态 肯 宫 烘 充 揭 情 勇 梁" --lang zh

   Optional flag: output. final output to local disk just like account_newkeys, If not specified output , print the results to the console

3. Account_restore.go calls the RetrieveAccountByMnemonic method of Accountutils.go, which is implemented by three crypto_client plugins, and passes in the language parameters of mnemonics and mnemonics. After the call, the result is that the wallet account includes the wallet address, public and private keys, etc. the result is printed and displayed on the console or exported (Optional flag: output)
